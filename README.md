# Snake Game (DSA Based) 🐍

## Description
This is a simple Snake Game implemented using Python with basic Data Structures and Algorithms concepts.  
The game logic is created using loops, arrays (lists), and conditional statements without using any external game libraries like Pygame.  
The project focuses on understanding core programming and problem-solving concepts.

## Features
- Snake movement using loops and conditions
- Snake body managed using arrays (lists)
- Food generation logic
- Game over condition handling
- Score tracking logic

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Data Structures (Arrays / Lists)
- Loops and Conditional Statements

## How to Run the Program
1. Clone the repository  
   https://github.com/Sak12345641/snake-game-dsa-python/tree/main

2. Navigate to the project folder  
   cd snake-game-dsa-python

3. Run the Python file  
   python snake.py
